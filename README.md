# Soil Sensor
This repo has two things:
1) Code for a Raspberry Pi to read soil moisture levels based on capacitance measurement of the soil.
2) A flask app to display the sensor data on a webpage.

The sensor code must be ran as a cron job on the RPi.

Saving my work without writing much documentation, so anybody who tries to use this repo might have a hard time (myself included).
